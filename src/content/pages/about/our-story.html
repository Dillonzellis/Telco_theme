            <p class="">Telco Plus Credit Union was started as East Texas Telco Credit Union on June 26, 1951. It was started as a state-chartered credit union out of the garage of a Longview home. The credit union served employees of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Longview. The credit union grew through mergers and members referring their friends and family until it relocated from the garage to its current location. A second branch opened in Tyler in 1996. In June of 2023 the the third location and second in Tyler will be opening. In 1997, the board changed the name of the credit union to Telco Plus Credit Union to better reflect the expanded membership base.</p>
