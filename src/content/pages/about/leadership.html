            <p>We started out as East Texas Telco Credit Union on June 26, 1951, as a state-chartered credit union in a garage of a Longview home. The credit union served employees of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Longview. As the credit union grew through mergers and members referring their friends and family to the credit union, the location was moved to its current location. A second branch in Tyler was added in 1996. In 1997, the board chose to change the name of the credit union to Telco Plus Credit Union to better reflect the expanded membership base.</p>

              <p class="">Since Telco Plus Credit Union is a community credit union, we actually support our community. Our wonderful, dedicated staff volunteers time and raises money for several great organizations in our area. We raise money every November for Longview PD and Tyler PD’s Project Blue Santa, collect peanut butter for the East Texas Food Bank’s backpack program; pick up trash for Keep Longview Beautiful and Keep Tyler Beautiful; we are a drop off location for Cellphones for Soldiers; and we offer free Financial Education to local schools and a $500 scholarship. We even help our Sponsor Companies when they need extra hands to run events.</p>
              <p class="[ fw-semi-bold ]">If you too would like to support our efforts, please see our staff, or help these great organizations directly! Be sure to follow our social media pages for current efforts.</p>
