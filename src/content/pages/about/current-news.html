              You now have one more choice to make your loan payments! Our newest option is to make payments with your checking account or debit card from other Financial Institutions. You will need Home Banking or the Mobile App. Once you have your login information, use the Transfer Tab to make your payment. Make sure NOT to exit the process before you see the redirecting message! You can store your payment method, so you don’t have to enter it each month. If you have any questions, please see Member Services.

              We are no longer taking loan payments over the phone. Our newest feature, where you can make a payment yourself through Home Banking or Mobile App, is a lot cheaper and more convenient due to 24 hour access. Please see Member Services if you need help setting up Home Banking.
