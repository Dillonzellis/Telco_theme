            <p class=""><em class="italic fs-14">*Your rate, term, loan amount, and payments will vary based on creditworthiness and loan underwriting guidelines. Loan terms range from 6 months to 72 months; interest rates range from 6.75% APR to 17.25% APR. Please visit our loan rate page for other rates. Our personal loans do not have fees, only the Quick Cash loan has an application fee, see below for those terms and conditions. Loan interest begins to accrue on the open date of the loan. Delaying the first payment for 30 days or more increases the amount of interest paid over the term of the loan.</em></p>

Total loan payments will be $1,036.74; $1,000 paid towards the principal borrowed and $36.74 to interest. A 12-month $1,000 loan with less than perfect credit may have a rate as high as 17.25% APR; and a payment of $92.

These loans are made by Sallie Mae Bank or a lender partner. Telco Plus Credit Union is not the creditor for these loans and is compensated by Sallie Mae for the referral of loan customers.</p>
