Only one request per 12 months, only one rate change per loan.</p>

              <div class="[ fw-semi-bold ] [ fs-18 ]">Credit Builder Certificate Deposit Loan</div>
              <p class="">This type of loan is like a savings account that you make payments towards and that reports to all three credit bureaus each month. A Credit Builder Loan is set up for $1,000 and you make scheduled monthly payments each month for 18 months.</p>
              <ul class="[ styled-list ] [ grid row-gap-05 ]">
                <li>Start with $55 in your certificate of deposit</li>

                <li>Monthly payments must be made on or before the scheduled date</li>
                <li>The monthly payments are approximately $60 <em class="italic">(amount is based on CD rate when CD is opened)</em></li>
                <li>You will build a good line of credit and have $1000 in your account</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="">The key to building credit is not maxing out your spending limit. We recommend that you keep your monthly credit card charges around 30-35% of your spending limit. It’s a good idea to pay your balance each month so that you don’t have to pay a finance charge. The payment history reports to the credit bureau(s).</p>

              <p class="">To make your student loan experience as simple and easy as possible, we encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college.

These loans are made by Sallie Mae Bank or a lender partner. Telco Plus Credit Union is not the creditor for these loans and is compensated by Sallie Mae for the referral of loan customers.</p>
