Credit scores often dramatically improve after 12 months of good payment history which could put you in a lower interest rate category. You must ask for a re-evaluation. Only one request per 12 months, only one rate change per loan.</p>

              <p class="">Secured installment loans and secured credit cards require a deposit and are reported to all three credit bureaus. Our free credit counseling is recommended by our local Better Business Bureau.

              <h4 class="[ fw-semi-bold ] [ fs-18 ]">Credit Builder Certificate Deposit Loan</h4>
              <p class="">This type of loan is like a savings account that you make payments towards and that reports to all three credit bureaus each month. A Credit Builder Loan is set up for $1,000 and you make scheduled monthly payments each month for 18 months.</p>
              <ul class="[ styled-list ] [ grid row-gap-05 ]">
                <li>Start with $55 in your certificate of deposit</li>
                <li>Each month there is a scheduled due date</li>
                <li>Monthly payments must be made on or before the scheduled date</li>
                <li>The monthly payments are approximately $60 <em class="italic">(amount is based on CD rate when CD is opened)</em></li>
                <li>You will build a good line of credit and have $1000 in your account</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="">The key to building credit is not maxing out your spending limit. We recommend that you keep your monthly credit card charges around 30-35% of your spending limit. It’s a good idea to pay your balance each month so that you don’t have to pay a finance charge. The payment history reports to the credit bureau(s).</p>
