      <p class="">
        <strong>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)</strong> - Throughout the life of your loan, the interest rate that is
        applied to the outstanding balance will vary. Adjustable-rate mortgage caps apply a limit to how much the
        interest rates or payments can rise per year or over the loan’s lifetime. Typically, an ARM is expressed as two
        numbers. Most of the time, the first number shows how long the fixed rate is applied to the loan. The second
        number shows how often it will change.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong> – The APR includes the origination fee, or fee you pay your lender
        to process your loan application, and other charges from interest on the mortgage at the annual interest rate.
        The
        APR will be higher than the ‘Locked-In’ interest rate because of the origination fee that is included in this
        calculation. It is a good guide for comparing the annual cost per loan with the different mortgage program
        types.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Appraisal</strong> – A licensed professional appraiser compiles information from properties that are
        comparable and details about the subject property.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Closing </strong>– To finalize the sale, the Buyer, Seller, Title Company’s Escrow Agent, and Real
        Estate
        Agents meet to finalize the sale.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Credit Report</strong> – This report reflects the payment history of a person. It is generated by full
        name, address, and social security number. This also reflects Public Records for any bankruptcy, liens, or
        judgments.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Discount Points</strong> – A fee paid by the buyer to decrease the interest rate of the mortgage. A
        ‘point’ is 1% of the loan amount.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Escrow</strong> – An account for the Buyer’s money that is set up through the mortgage lending process.
        It
        is for the payment of future property taxes and one year of homeowner’s insurance.
      </p>

      <p class=""><strong>Loan Origination</strong> – The fee for mortgage financing services.</p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Loan Origination Points</strong> – a fee that’s paid by the Buyer to the Lender above loan origination.
        A ‘point’ is 1% of the loan amount.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <strong>Prepaids</strong> – These are the property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and the interest paid outside
        of the closing or included in the fees of the mortgage loan.
      </p>

      <p class=""><strong>Principal </strong>– This is the true balance amount of the mortgage, not including the
        interest.</p>
