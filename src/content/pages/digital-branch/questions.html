            <p class="">Secured Consumer Loans except mortgage loans or credit cards, are eligible to be re-evaluated after 12 months to see if you qualify for a lower interest rate. Credit scores dramatically improve after 12 months of good payment history, and this could put you in a lower interest rate category. You must ask for the re-evaluation. Only one request per 12 months, only one rate change per loan. Min 12-months of consecutive on time payments. IF you think you qualify for a review you can email loan review requests to: loanlist@telcoplus.org</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg fw-semi-bold">Can I lower my loan rate with Telco Plus?</h3>
          <p class="">- Secured Consumer Loans except mortgage loans or credit cards, are eligible to be re-evaluated after 12 months to see if you qualify for a lower interest rate. Credit scores dramatically improve after 12 months of good payment history, and this could put you in a lower interest rate category. You must ask for the re-evaluation. Only one request per 12 months, only one rate change per loan. Min 12-months of consecutive on time payments. IF you think you qualify for a review you can email loan review requests to: loanlist@telcoplus.org</p>
