            <p>We started out as East Texas Telco Credit Union on June 26, 1951, as a state-chartered credit union in a garage of a Longview home. The credit union served employees of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Longview. As the credit union grew through mergers and members referring their friends and family to the credit union, the location was moved to its current location. A second branch in Tyler was added in 1996. In 1997, the board chose to change the name of the credit union to Telco Plus Credit Union to better reflect the expanded membership base.</p>
