<span class=FontFour>Given the current payment, principal, interest rate, and the life of the new loan, <STRONG>Refinance Calculator</STRONG> will calculate your new loan payment, your monthly savings, and the number of months it will take you to "break-even" on your new loan.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Refinance Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, to calculate the savings on a refinanced loan of $250,000 at 30 years, where the current payment is $2,000, the interest rate is 8%, the mortgage costs total $500, and the points charged on the new mortgage is 1.25%, you would enter 2000 in the current payment box, 250000 in the loan amount box, 8 in the interest rate box, 360 in the numbers of months box, 500 in the mortgage costs box, and you would choose 1.250% in the mortgage points box. When you click the calculate button, your result appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Refinance Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to calculate another refinanced loan with different values, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>
